Face Detection
===
This repo is used to develop an app based on osdt mep
-----
This is an application for detecting faces either from face or video.  The service was developed on the basis of an open project for ultra-fast face detection on Github. The project is characterized by the following：

This application exposes only three rest API. 2 rest API for face detection from video and 1 rest API for the face detection from the image.

For the video rest API, it takes input as a video and returns back the output id. Then the second rest interface is used the output id to display the result.

The 3rd rest interface is used for face detection using the image. It takes an image as an input and produces output the image in which the face detected is marked.
