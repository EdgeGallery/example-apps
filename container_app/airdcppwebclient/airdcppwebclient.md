# AirDC++ Web Client

AirDC++ Web Client is a locally installed application, which is designed for frequent sharing of files or directories within groups of people in a local network or over internet. The daemon application can be installed on different types of systems, such as on file servers and NAS devices.

The application uses [Advanced Direct Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Direct_Connect) protocol, which allows creating file sharing communities with thousands of users. The application itself is highly optimized even for extreme use cases: a single client can be used to share more than 10 million files or hundreds of terabytes of data.
